# 🐼 My Pandas Journey — Challenge Completed! 🎉


I’m thrilled to share that I have successfully completed a **Pandas Challenge** and earned my certificate from CodeChef! 🎓✨

With Pandas, I learned how to:  
- Load, explore, and clean data efficiently  
- Handle missing values gracefully  
- Filter and select data dynamically  
- Perform aggregations and group operations  
- Work with time series data  
- And much more!
